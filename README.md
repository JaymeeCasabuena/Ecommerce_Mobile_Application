# Fake Store - Final Submission

**Note:** This project is currently under construction. I am performing a design and code review to ensure that best practices are applied throughout the application.

## Overview

The "Fake Store" is a mobile application developed using React Native, integrating with both the [fakestoreapi](https://fakestoreapi.com) website and a custom-built Fake Store API server. The application simulates a comprehensive online shopping experience, featuring various functionalities as outlined in the assignment specifications.

## Project Integration

In addition to the assignment requirements, I created my own server using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This server facilitates client-server interactions, ensuring that data is handled efficiently and securely.
